# eVTOLs-as-Air-Ambulance
Master Thesis of my two-years long Data Science MSc. @ Universita Bocconi 

Code in the main file in the outcome of my final project for the master thesis.

Background:
As the electrical Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOLs) technology is making frog-leaps in the recent years 
it is becoming a rather interesting field to focus on while rethinking mobility. The topic was chosen after 
reading a TechCrunch article about Wisk company signing an agreement with New Zealand for testing Wisk's eVTOL
over the New Zealand's territory. After careful market research, an optimal first-adoption application of the 
eVTOL usage was found in ambulance industry. I decided to focus on the particular application thanks to the ideal
conditions pushing the innovation (NZ's geography, current ambulance costs etc.). 

Outcome:
An optimization of the theoretical locations of the newly-proposed system of Air Ambulances on the New Zealand's territory
was establish. The operating costs and well as time-to-patient would be cut down significantly when compared to the current 
system of ground ambulance.
